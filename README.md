## Hi, Iâ€™m Carlos ðŸ‘‹

I became interested in web development during the pandemic. I am currently a student at California State University Polytechnic Pamona, majoring in Civil engineering. I love to learn and solve problems, and what I enjoy most is tackling problems with others. I enjoy the rush and, most importantly, the feeling of finding a solution to a complex problem. However, when I discovered Front-end web development, I felt like it was everything I was looking for in a job. I'm a visual learner, and I find it easier to see what I work on and get instant feedback. There's so much to learn in tech, and I feel like the possibilities are endless! I quickly began my web development journey and found myself never wanting to go back. My end goal is to become a full-stack web developer.


## In short

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m always interested in learning new skills. I have many hobbies but my favorite has to be coding!
- ðŸŒ± I'm a big fan of Frontend Mentor. Love both working on their challenges and giving feedback to others.
- âš¡ Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborate on some fun projects to exhilerate my coding career!
